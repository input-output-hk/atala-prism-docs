# Overview

Enterprise services is a comprehensive suite of services available exclusively
as part of the Enterprise edition of the Identus platform. These services
aim to empower businesses to integrate SSI-based (Self-Sovereign Identity)
effortlessly into their existing solutions, providing their users and business
partners with greater control over their identity and personal data. At the same
time, we handle the technical complexities behind it.

The Enterprise services suite currently includes ManageUI, Onboard, and 
Authenticate services. The ManageUI is a web-based application to manage the 
PRISM product suite. Use it to create and manage credential schemas and 
verification policies within a user-friendly graphical interface. The Onboard 
and Authenticate services provide a streamlined approach to authenticate users 
and things based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) within their control.

In the future, we plan to expand the Enterprise services suite by adding more
services. These services allow organizations to implement SSI-based features in
their applications and seamlessly integrate with external systems. We aim to
ensure that the Enterprise services suite continues to evolve and grow to meet
the changing needs as the industry grows.
